if, we dont specify  "depends-on" in beans,
then 
<bean id="jdk" class="beans.JDK" />
<bean id="jre" class="beans.JRE" />
<bean id="jvm" class="beans.JVM" />

output:                                  JDK created
                                                   JRE created
                                                   JVM created
                                                   
                                      **   it'll follow  the order
As we know that,
												       
												       most inner part is JVM
												       JVM+library classes => JRE
												       JRE+development tools => JDK
												       
so, first, jvm needs to be created. then jre and then jdk. 
so, jdk has a dependency of jre and jre has a dependency of jvm

in xml, we need to declare like this:
												<bean id="jre" class="beans.JRE" depends-on="jvm" />
												<bean id="jdk" class="beans.JDK" depends-on="jre"/>                                           
                                                <bean id="jvm" class="beans.JVM" />
           
           
           output:                        JVM created
                                                   JRE created
                                                   JDK created 
                                       ** it'll not follow the order. it'll create objects as per dependency
